# syntax-transcripts-experiments

> Repo for experimenting with Syntax.fm transcripts with Go. Made with help of [`transcripts.json`](https://gist.github.com/wesbos/19640f6fd516a08569c6b6b569513ec9/) generated by Wes Bos

## How to use?

You'll need to have Go environment setup. Next, just enter `go run experiments/<experiment_name>/<experiment_name>.go`, to run the experiment. For example, try `go run experiments/sick/sick.go`

## Contributing

If you have an idea for interesting experiment or improvment for the repo, _fork the repo_, _add your changes_ and _submit a pull request_ :D

## Experiments

1. `sick.go` - Check how many times Scott and Wes have said the _sick_ word!
2. `talk_time.go` - See how much time the guys have spent talking.
3. `occurencies.go` - Counts and sorts all the words by how often they're used. Generates a JSON with 100 most often used words (overall, by Scott and by Wes). Feel free to play with it and maybe create a list of least used words!
